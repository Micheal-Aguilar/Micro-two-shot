## Design

## Shoes microservice

Explain your models and integration with the wardrobe
microservice, here. I will be making a model with fields for with the manufacturer name, color, model name, a picture url, and which bin the shoe is in. The poller will be pulling in the bins from the wardrobe microservice.

## Hats microservice

The model will be tracking the hats fabric, its style name, its color, a URL for a picture, and the location in the wardrobe where it exists.Creating React components to show a list of all hats and their details, also show a form to create a new hat. ALso provide a way to delete a hat
